# Agent Development Guide

A file for [guiding coding agents](https://agents.md/).

## Commands

- **Build:** `zig build`
  - If you're on macOS and don't need to build the macOS app, use
    `-Demit-macos-app=false` to skip building the app bundle and speed up
    compilation.
- **Test (Zig):** `zig build test`
  - Prefer to run targeted tests with `-Dtest-filter` because the full
    test suite is slow to run.
- **Test filter (Zig)**: `zig build test -Dtest-filter=<test name>`
- **Snapshot (macOS app)**: `zig-out/Naut.app/Contents/MacOS/Naut --snapshot out.png [--note Name] [--light]`
  - Renders the window, including the web preview and toolbar, to a PNG
    and quits. Needs no Screen Recording permission. Look at a snapshot
    after every UI change; "it builds" is not "it looks right".
- **Formatting (Zig)**: `zig fmt .`
- **Formatting (Swift)**: `swiftlint lint --strict --fix`
- **Formatting (other)**: `prettier -w .`

## Directory Structure

- Shared Zig core: `src/`
- macOS app: `macos/`
